Easily deliver real-time, beautiful pop-up surveys and polls on your WordPress site. Free for life.

== Description ==

IgniteFeedback is a Free WordPress plug-in that makes it ridiculously easy to learn about your customers by asking surveys from a "toast" on your WordPress site. We're different from the other guys because of our stunningly good user experience and the fact that we put way more value into our Free accounts!

= Major features include: =

* Deliver short, easy pop-up surveys to visitors on your website.
* Provide the best looking, most painless surveys on WordPress.
* Receive instant notifications when someone responds (or setup a weekly/monthly report).
* Use simple or advanced targeting rules so you can answer precise questions like:
 - How did "new" users hear about your site?
 - What do "returning" visitors think about your customer experience?
 - Is there anything holding back visitors from converting?
* Adjust the style and behavior of your survey so it matches your site exactly.
* Advanced features like branching, internationalization, login integration and CRM data targeting for enterprise users.
* Free Zapier integration to connect your data with over 600 apps!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is it really Free? =

Yes! We have a 100% free plan which includes the same great User Experience of IgniteFeedback as well as features of our paid plans which start at $9 a month. The only difference between our Free and Paid plains is in the number of responses supported.

= Is there advertising in the Free version? =

Nope, it is 100% free and without ads.

= What do you mean by real-time surveys? =

We mean that our surveys can be delivered in a very precise and targeted way so that you only engage with customers where and when you want to. The results of the survey can be shared directly with the visitor (or hidden if you prefer), and an email can be sent to notify you of their response.

= Why is the word "abbreviation" so long? =

Sorry, you totally stumped us on that one.
